# GLYCAN CLEARANCE CURVES: SITE AND CLUSTER COMPARISON USING POWER BI
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Abstract:

The analysis of glycan clearance behavior is essential for enhancing the efficacy and
stability of therapeutic proteins in drug development and delivery. Glycans—complex
carbohydrate structures attached to proteins—significantly influence
pharmacokinetics, including drug stability, efficacy, and clearance rates. This project
systematically evaluates and compares glycan clearance patterns across multiple
production sites (A–E) using glycan concentration data collected over specific time
intervals. Key numerical descriptors, such as Area Under the Curve (AUC),
half-life are calculated to quantify glycan clearance and classify them into rapid,
intermediate, and slow-clearance categories.

To uncover underlying clearance patterns, K-means clustering is employed based
on AUC and half-life values. Using the Elbow Method, three optimal clusters are
identified:

● Rapid-clearance glycans: Characterized by short half-lives and low AUC,
indicating limited therapeutic duration.


● Intermediate-clearance glycans: Display moderate clearance behavior,
balancing stability and clearance.


● Slow-clearance glycans: Feature extended half-lives and high AUC values,
contributing to prolonged therapeutic effects.

An interactive Power BI dashboard has been developed to provide a dynamic and
visual representation of glycan behavior. The dashboard includes tools such as
stacked bar plots, line charts, and card visualizations, enabling detailed
site-specific and glycan-specific comparisons.

By integrating numerical analysis, clustering techniques, and interactive
visualizations, this study delivers actionable insights into glycan clearance behavior.
It establishes a robust framework for optimizing therapeutic protein design and
improving drug delivery systems, thereby addressing critical challenges in
pharmaceutical manufacturing and development.
